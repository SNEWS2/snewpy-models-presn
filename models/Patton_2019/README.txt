Included here are the neutrino luminosities for 15 and 30 solar mass stars as a function of time and energy.  We consider contributions from pair and beta processes. 

Files titled "totalLuminosity_XXSolarMass.dat" include the total luminosity as a function of energy for all times for 15 and 30 solar mass stars with the following columns:
	[1] tau_cc (hr)
        [2] neutrino energy (MeV)
        [3] Lnue - electron neutrino luminosity (1/MeV/s)
        [4] Lnuebar - electron antineutrino luminosity (1/MeV/s)
        [5] Lnux - mu/tau neutrino luminosity (1/MeV/s)
        [6] Lnuxbar - mu/tau antineutrino luminosity (1/MeV/s)
        [7] Lnue Beta - electron neutrino luminosity from beta processes (1/MeV/s)
        [8] Lnuebar Beta - electron antineutrino luminosity from beta processes (1/MeV/s)
        [9] Lnue Pair - electron neutrino luminosity from pair processes (1/MeV/s)
        [10] Lnuebar Pair - electron antineutrino luminosity from pair processes (1/MeV/s)

Files included in "XXNuSeprateIsotopes" cover the beta luminosity split by isotope. There are two files for each time step, one for neutrinos and one for antineutrinos.  The time, in hours to collapse, is in the file name. Isotopes are separated by empty lines in the file and identified by the parent and daughter nuclei (e.g. # h1 --> neut).  The columns are:
	[1] - neutrino energy (MeV)
	[2] - capture luminosity (1/MeV/s)
	[3] - decay luminosity (1/MeV/s)
